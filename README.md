 Merge Sort
Merge Sort simply divides the array to be sorted continuously by two elements 
until they reach the emaining pieces. Then they merge these pieces into themselves. 
In this respect, itâ€™s based on the "divide and conquer" paradigm.


In this repository, implemented sequential and parallelized versions of the Merge Sort
- Sequential version
- Parallel version using executor service
- Parallel version using a fork/join pool
